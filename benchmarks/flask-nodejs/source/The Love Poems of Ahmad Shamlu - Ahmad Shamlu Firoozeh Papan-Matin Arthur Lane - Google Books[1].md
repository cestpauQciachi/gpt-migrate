One of the most remarkable features of Shamlu's love poems is his use of imagery and symbolism. He often draws inspiration from nature, such as the sun, the moon, the stars, the sea, the wind, the flowers, and the birds. He also uses colors and their variations to create different moods and atmospheres. For example, in his poem "Tell Your Most Beautiful Words", he writes:

> Tell your most beautiful words
 Release your pain of silence
 Don't be scared if they say
 Your words are useless
 Because our words
 Are not useless melodies

In this poem, he encourages his beloved to express her feelings and thoughts, and not to be afraid of criticism or rejection. He assures her that their words are meaningful and valuable, and that they can create a harmony between them.
  
Another characteristic of Shamlu's love poems is his use of repetition and variation. He often repeats certain words or phrases, with slight changes or additions, to emphasize his point or to create a rhythm. For example, in his poem "In This Dead-End", he writes:

> They smell your mouth
 To find out if you have told someone: I love you!
 They smell your heart!
 Such a strange time it is, my darling.
 And they punish love
 By flogging at the road-cross,
 We must hide our love in dark closets.

In this poem, he denounces the oppression and violence that he and his beloved face in their society. He repeats the word "they" to show the contrast between them and the authorities who try to control their lives. He also repeats the phrase "smell your" to show how intrusive and absurd their actions are. He then adds different words after each repetition, such as "mouth", "heart", and "love", to show how they target different aspects of their identity and emotions.
  
Shamlu's love poems are not only expressions of his personal feelings, but also reflections of his social and political views. He often criticizes the injustice and corruption that he witnesses in his country, and calls for freedom and democracy. He also shows solidarity with the oppressed and marginalized people, such as the workers, the peasants, the women, and the minorities. He believes that love is a powerful force that can inspire people to resist tyranny and to create a better world.
