- Love vs. Tradition: The novel shows how love can be hindered by tradition, especially when it comes to social status and background. Zainuddin and Hayati's love is doomed from the start because of their different origins and positions in Minangkabau society. They are forced to choose between their love and their family's honor.
- Fate vs. Free Will: The novel also shows how fate can be cruel and unpredictable, and how human beings have limited control over their destiny. Zainuddin and Hayati's fate is sealed by the sinking of the van der Wijck ship, which symbolizes their tragic end. They are unable to escape their fate despite their efforts and sacrifices.
- Islam vs. Adat: The novel also shows how Islam can be a source of guidance and inspiration for human beings, and how adat (customs) can be a source of oppression and injustice. Hamka, as an Islamic scholar, advocates for a more progressive and egalitarian interpretation of Islam that respects human dignity and rights. He also criticizes the adat of Minangkabau that discriminates against mixed-race people and women.
