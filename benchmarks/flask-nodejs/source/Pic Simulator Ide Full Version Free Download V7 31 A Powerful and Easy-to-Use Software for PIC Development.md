If you are looking for a user-friendly graphical development environment for Windows with integrated simulator (emulator), pic basic compiler, assembler, disassembler and debugger for Microchip microcontrollers, you might want to check out PIC Simulator IDE. This software supports the extensive number of microcontrollers (MCUs) from the Microchip 8-bit PIC Mid-Range architecture product line (selected PIC16F, PIC12F, PIC10F models).
 
PIC Simulator IDE allows you to create, test, deploy and debug applications for the Microchip 8-bit PIC Mid-Range architecture product line. You can edit the FLASH program memory, EEPROM data memory and hardware stack of the microcontroller, as well as simulate the digital I/O and analog inputs of the microcontroller pinout interface. You can also define and manage input stimulus files that contain the list of changes on digital and analog inputs at desired real time moments during the code simulation with execution tracking.

PIC Simulator IDE also provides you with a powerful PIC Basic compiler with smart Basic source editor. The PIC Basic compiler supports various data types, arrays, strings, procedures, functions, Modbus master/slave implementation, MMC/SD/SDSC/SDHC cards implementation (with FAT16 and FAT32 file system support), high level language support for using internal EEPROM memory, A/D converter module, interrupts, serial communication using internal hardware UART or software UART, I2C communication, SPI communication, character LCDs, graphical LCDs with 128x64 dot matrix, R/C servos, stepper motor control, 1-Wire devices, DS18S20, PWM modules and more. The PIC Basic compiler also includes a PID Controller implementation (with the auto tuning feature) and a PID Controller Process Simulator.
 
PIC Simulator IDE also offers other useful features such as configuration bits editor, PC's serial port terminal for communication with real devices connected to serial port, LCD module simulation interface for character LCD modules and graphical LCD module simulation interface for 128x64 graphical LCD modules.
