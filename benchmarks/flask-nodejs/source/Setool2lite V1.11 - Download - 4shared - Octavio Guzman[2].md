Before using Setool2lite V1.11, you need to install the USB flash driver on your computer. This driver will allow Setool2lite to communicate with your phone via USB cable. To install the USB flash driver, follow these steps:

The first thing you need to do is to select your phone model from the drop-down list at the top left corner. Make sure you select the correct model that matches your phone's platform and CID (color identification). You can check your phone's platform and CID by pressing \*#\*#7378423#\*#\* on your phone's keypad and going to Service Info > Software Info.
 
The next thing you need to do is to select the interface that you will use to connect your phone to your computer. You have three options:

- USB: this is the recommended option as it is faster and easier. You will need a DCU-60 USB cable to use this option.
- UFS: this option is not supported by Setool2lite V1.11, so do not use it.
- COMx: this option allows you to use a serial port cable (such as FTDI-based service cable) to connect your phone to your computer. This option is slower than USB and requires more steps to set up.

If you choose USB, you don't need to change anything else in the interface section. If you choose COMx, you need to select the correct COM port number from the drop-down list next to COMx and adjust the baud rate if necessary.
