Toilet: Ek Prem Katha is not only a comedy film, but also a social commentary on the lack of sanitation facilities in rural India. According to a 2019 report by the World Health Organization and UNICEF, India has made significant progress in reducing open defecation, but still has 50 million people who practice it. Open defecation poses serious health and environmental risks, such as diarrhoea, intestinal worms, malnutrition, stunting, and water pollution. It also affects the dignity and safety of women and girls, who face harassment and violence when they have to defecate in the open.
 
The film is inspired by the real-life story of Anita Narre, a woman from Madhya Pradesh who left her husband Shivram Narre in 2011 after finding out that he did not have a toilet in his house. Her decision sparked a media frenzy and a social movement, and eventually led to the construction of toilets in her village and nearby areas. She also received an award from the then-rural development minister Jairam Ramesh for her courage and initiative.
 
Toilet: Ek Prem Katha is a film that celebrates the power of love and the spirit of change. It shows how one woman's stand can inspire a whole community to improve their living conditions and demand their rights. It also highlights the role of the government and the media in promoting sanitation and hygiene awareness among the masses. The film has received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, and has been praised for its humor, realism, and message. It has also been screened at various international film festivals and forums, such as the London Indian Film Festival, the Busan International Film Festival, and the United Nations.
