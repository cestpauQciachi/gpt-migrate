## Step 2: Verify Windows 8 x86 English ISO
 
The next step is to verify the integrity of the file you have downloaded. This is important because it ensures that the file has not been corrupted or tampered with during the download process. To verify the file, you need to compare its checksum with the original checksum provided by Microsoft. A checksum is a unique string of numbers and letters that identifies a file.
 
To calculate the checksum of the file, you need to use a tool such as MD5 & SHA Checksum Utility.

After downloading and installing the tool, open it and browse for the file you have downloaded. The tool will automatically calculate and display the checksums for MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 algorithms.
 
The checksum you need to compare is the SHA-1 checksum. The original SHA-1 checksum for Windows 8 x86 English ISO provided by Microsoft is: `22D680EC53336BEE8A5B276A972CEBA104787F62`. If your checksum matches this one, it means that your file is valid and safe to use. If your checksum does not match, it means that your file is corrupted or modified and you need to download it again.

The third step is to create a bootable media using Windows 8 x86 English ISO. A bootable media is a USB flash drive or DVD that contains the installation files for Windows 8 and can be used to start your computer and install Windows 8 on it.

Make sure that your media has at least 4 GB of free space. Then, click on the "SELECT" button next to the "Boot selection" option and browse for the file you have downloaded. Rufus will automatically detect that it is an ISO image and select it.
